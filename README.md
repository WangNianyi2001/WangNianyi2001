I'm a software developer from Beijing, China.
I've been doing programming as a hobbyist since primary school.
Currently I'm studying game development in Communication University of China.

I mainly write webpages (mostly media presenters, and sometimes browser-integrated tools), browser userscripts, code toolkits that support my daily usage, games based on Unity and silly stuffs.

Looking for job opportunities (*especially overseas*).
