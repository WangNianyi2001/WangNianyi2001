## Hello There

I'm a software developer from Beijing, China.
I've been doing programming as a hobbyist since primary school.
Currently I'm studying game development in Communication University of China.

I mainly write webpages (mostly media presenters, and sometimes browser-integrated tools), browser userscripts, code toolkits that support my daily usage, games based on Unity and silly stuffs.

Looking for job oppotunities (*especially overseas*).

## More About Me

I speak mandarin Chinese & English; I'm kind of learning Japanese but I find memoizing the vocabs too hard for me.

I have plenty of hobbies:
mathematics, linguistics, Hiphop music (especially Eminem), city planning, photography, font design, etc.

You can check out my [personal blog](WangNianyi2001.github.io), it is hosted with Github Pages.
