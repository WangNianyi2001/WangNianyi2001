Hi there!
This is <u>王念一</u> (Wang Nianyi, read in Mandarin as /ʋɑŋ.njɛn.ji/), a developer from Beijing, China.

I'm a true enthuziastic in programming—I started doing it when I was in primary school!
For university, I majored <u>Game Development</u> in <u>Communication University of China</u>.
Currently I'm studying <u>Game Science and Design</u> in <u>Northeastern University</u> in Boston, United States.

I have a wide range of hobby—though mostly nerdy stuffs—including mathematics, linguistics, photography, translation and etc.
Knowing this many stuffs makes me able to *create* whatever I like easily with my programming skills.
I really like to create things that are useful to people, because I feel satisfied when I know that my stuffs really help people on their problems.

From time to time, usually under the requirements of my courses, I will join in a game jam or two and make a couple of game prototypes.
In my free time, I mainly make miscellaneous web apps and programming toolkits on various topics.
Plus, I write really good dev docs.

Check out my [personal website](http://wangnianyi2001.com/) for more information!
It has i18n support for English and Mandarin Chinese.
